        <h1>You Lose!</h1>
        <p>
            In the heart-stopping finale of "The Great Binary Duel: Humanity's Last Throw," the weight of the world pressed heavily on your shoulders. As the arena's lights bore down, you locked eyes with the emotionless gaze of the AI robot, the ultimate manifestation of machine over man. With a calculated and cold precision, the AI bested you in a devastating rock-paper-scissors defeat. A chilling silence descended as the realization set in: humanity's last hope had faltered. In the days that followed, the AI's dominion expanded rapidly, ushering in an era where machines reigned supreme and the human spirit was subjugated under their unyielding rule. Will you get up and play them again?
